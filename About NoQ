# Project Title & Abstract

Token Based Queue Management System for Restaurants


In today's fast-paced world, time is of the essence, and people are always on the lookout for ways to
save time and increase efficiency. One area where people often spend a lot of time waiting in line is
at various public places such as banks, government offices, hospitals, and other service centres. The
traditional method of waiting in a physical queue is not only time-consuming but also frustrating and
inefficient. The solution to this problem lies in the adoption of a digital token system that eliminates
the physical queue and enables customers to book their spot in the queue remotely

## Project Aim

This project aims to develop a token-based queue management system that eliminates the need for
physical queues in restaurants. The system allows customers to order food through a web application
and generates a token for them to collect their packed order physically. This approach saves time and
improves efficiency for both customers and restaurant staff by eliminating the need for customers to
wait in a physical queue. The web application will be designed to be user-friendly, with real-time
updates on the status of orders and estimated waiting times. The system will be beneficial for
restaurants, as it will reduce the workload on staff and improve the overall customer experience. By
integrating online ordering with a token-based queue management system, the project aims to
streamline the food ordering process and provide a seamless experience for customers.
